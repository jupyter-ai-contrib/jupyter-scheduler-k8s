# Jupyter Scheduler K8s - Development Guide

This project provides a Kubernetes backend for Jupyter Scheduler. This guide covers common development tasks.

## Project Structure

- `src/jupyter_scheduler_k8s/` - Main Python package (currently empty)
- `image/` - Docker image configuration with Pixi-based Python environment
- `local-dev/` - Local development configuration (Kind cluster)
- `Makefile` - Build and development automation

## Prerequisites

- **macOS**: Finch (for container management)
- **Kind**: For local Kubernetes clusters
- **Python 3.13+**: Required by pyproject.toml

## Common Development Tasks

### Initial Setup

```bash
# Initialize Finch VM and create Kind cluster
make setup
```

This command:
- Detects macOS and initializes/starts Finch VM
- Creates a Kind cluster named 'jupyter-scheduler-k8s'
- Sets up kubeconfig at `local-dev/kind/.kubeconfig`

### Build Docker Image

```bash
# Build the application Docker image
make build-image
```

Builds `jupyter-scheduler-k8s:latest` using:
- Base: `ghcr.io/prefix-dev/pixi:0.50.2-bookworm-slim`
- Pixi environment management
- Notebook executor supporting parameter injection and file packaging

### Kubernetes Development

```bash
# Configure kubectl for Kind cluster
make kubectl-kind

# Test cluster connection
kubectl get nodes
```

### Cleanup

```bash
# Remove Kind cluster and stop Finch VM
make clean
```

## Dependencies

The project uses:
- `jupyter-scheduler>=2.11.0` - Core scheduler functionality
- `jupyterlab>=4.4.5` - Jupyter Lab integration  
- `kubernetes>=33.1.0` - Kubernetes API client
- `uv` for build system

## Implementation Notes

- Container built with Pixi for cross-platform support
- `image/main.py` handles notebook execution via nbconvert (same as jupyter-scheduler)
- Code follows high quality standards: no over-engineering, meaningful logging only, graceful error handling
- Parameter injection matches jupyter-scheduler's approach exactly
- `PACKAGE_INPUT_FOLDER` env var enables copying all files from notebook directory (matching jupyter-scheduler's `package_input_folder` feature)

## Development Status

- Phase 1: Container implementation âœ…
- Phase 2: K8sExecutionManager (extends jupyter-scheduler's ExecutionManager)

## Code Quality Standards

- **Comments**: Only add comments that explain parts of code that are not evident from the code itself
- Explain WHY something is done when the reasoning isn't obvious
- Explain WHAT is being done when the code logic is complex or non-obvious
- If the code is self-evident, no comment is needed
- **Quality**: Insist on highest quality standards while avoiding over-engineering
- **Scope**: Stay strictly within defined scope - no feature creep or unnecessary complexity
