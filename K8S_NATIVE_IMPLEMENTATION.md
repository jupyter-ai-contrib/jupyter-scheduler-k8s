# K8s-Native Implementation - Summary of Changes

## Overview
Refactored jupyter-scheduler-k8s to be pure K8s-native, removing all SQLite dependencies and mode detection. All K8s classes now work together cohesively as a single application.

## Key Architecture Changes

### 1. K8sScheduler - Pure K8s Implementation
**File:** `jupyter_scheduler_k8s/scheduler.py`

#### Removed:
- ❌ `_is_k8s_native_mode()` method - no more mode detection
- ❌ All `super()` calls to base class database methods
- ❌ SQLite fallback logic
- ❌ Import of `K8sSession` for mode detection

#### Changed:
- ✅ `create_job_definition()` - Generates own UUID, creates K8s CronJob directly
- ✅ `delete_job_definition()` - Deletes K8s CronJob directly, no database cleanup
- ✅ `update_job_definition()` - Updates K8s CronJob directly
- ✅ `delete_job()` - Deletes K8s Job directly
- ✅ `create_job_from_definition()` - Creates K8s Job directly instead of using super()

#### Added:
- ✅ `_create_pod_template_for_manual_job()` - Helper for manually triggered jobs

### 2. K8sSession - Creates Actual K8s Resources
**File:** `jupyter_scheduler_k8s/k8s_orm.py`

#### Changed:
- ✅ `add()` method now creates K8s Jobs immediately
  - Converts job models to K8s Job resources
  - Stores all metadata in annotations and labels
  - No buffering - K8s operations are immediate
- ✅ `commit()` - Now a no-op (K8s has no transactions)
- ✅ `rollback()` - Now a no-op (K8s has no transactions)

#### Implementation:
```python
def add(self, job_model):
    """Create K8s Job immediately - K8s doesn't have transactions."""
    if hasattr(job_model, 'job_id'):
        # Create actual K8s Job with metadata
        k8s_job = client.V1Job(...)
        self.k8s_batch.create_namespaced_job(...)
```

### 3. K8sQuery - Simplified Direct K8s Operations
**File:** `jupyter_scheduler_k8s/k8s_orm.py`

- Kept existing label-based querying
- Returns proper Job/JobDefinition objects
- No SQLAlchemy condition parsing complexity

### 4. K8sDatabaseManager - Minimal Adapter
**File:** `jupyter_scheduler_k8s/database_manager.py`

- Returns K8sSession that creates actual K8s resources
- Compatible with jupyter-scheduler's DatabaseManager interface

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. No Mode Detection
- K8sScheduler ALWAYS works K8s-native
- No hybrid SQLite/K8s modes
- Simpler, more maintainable

### 2. Direct K8s Operations
- No SQLAlchemy abstractions where not needed
- K8s API calls are explicit and clear
- K8s resources ARE the database

### 3. Jobs-as-Records Pattern
- K8s Jobs serve as both workload AND database records
- Metadata stored in labels (for queries) and annotations (full data)
- No separate database needed

### 4. Clean Separation
- All K8s classes work together as one application
- No dependencies on SQLite
- Clear boundaries between K8s and jupyter-scheduler

## Usage

All three K8s classes must be used together:

```python
from jupyter_scheduler_k8s import K8sScheduler, K8sDatabaseManager, K8sExecutionManager

# Launch with all K8s components
jupyter lab \
  --SchedulerApp.scheduler_class="jupyter_scheduler_k8s.K8sScheduler" \
  --Scheduler.database_manager_class="jupyter_scheduler_k8s.K8sDatabaseManager" \
  --Scheduler.execution_manager_class="jupyter_scheduler_k8s.K8sExecutionManager" \
  --Scheduler.db_url="k8s://default"
```

## Benefits

1. **Simpler Architecture**: No dual modes, no complex detection logic
2. **True K8s-Native**: Uses K8s resources as intended
3. **No SQLite Dependency**: Pure K8s implementation
4. **Maintainable**: Clear, direct operations without abstraction layers
5. **Cohesive**: All K8s classes designed to work together

## Testing

Created `test_job_definitions.py` to verify:
- Job definition creation (K8s CronJobs)
- Job definition listing and retrieval
- Job definition updates
- Manual job triggering from definitions
- Job definition deletion

## Migration Notes

For existing deployments:
1. No longer supports hybrid SQLite + K8s mode
2. Must use all three K8s classes together
3. Existing SQLite data not migrated (K8s-only going forward)
4. S3 bucket still required for file staging

## Technical Details

### Label Schema
All K8s resources use consistent labels:
- `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: jupyter-scheduler-k8s`
- `scheduler.jupyter.org/job-id: <job-id>`
- `scheduler.jupyter.org/job-definition-id: <definition-id>`
- `scheduler.jupyter.org/status: <status>`
- `scheduler.jupyter.org/name: <sanitized-name>`

### Annotation Schema
Full job data stored as JSON in:
- `scheduler.jupyter.org/job-data` - For Jobs
- `scheduler.jupyter.org/job-definition-data` - For CronJobs

This ensures all metadata survives server restarts and enables full reconstruction of job state from K8s resources alone.
